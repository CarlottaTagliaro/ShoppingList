                <h3><b>What Personal Information About Customers Does ShoppingList Gather?</b></h3>

                <p>The information we learn from customers helps us personalize and continually improve your ShoppingList experience. Here are the types of information we gather.</p>

                <ul>
                    <li><b>Information You Give Us:</b> We receive and store any information you enter on our Web site or give us in any other way. You can choose not to provide certain information, but then you might not be able to take advantage of many of our features. We use the information that you provide for such purposes as responding to your requests, customizing future shopping for you, improving our stores, and communicating with you. </li>
                    <li><b>Automatic Information:</b> We receive and store certain types of information whenever you interact with us. For example, like many Web sites, we use "cookies" and we obtain certain types of information when your Web browser accesses ShoppingList.</li>
                    <li><b>Mobile:</b> When you download or use apps created by ShoppingList, we may receive information about your location and your mobile device, including a unique identifier for your device. We may use this information to provide you with location-based services, such as advertising, search results, and other personalized content. Most mobile devices allow you to turn off location services. </li>
                    <li><b>Information from Other Sources:</b> We might receive information about you from other sources and add it to our account information.</li>
                </ul>
            </div>

            <div id="cookies">
                <h3><b>What About Cookies?</b></h3>

                <p>Cookies are unique identifiers that we transfer to your device to enable our systems to recognize your device and to provide features such as 1-Click purchasing, Recommended for You, and storage of items in your Shopping Cart between visits.</p>
                <p>The Help feature on most browsers will tell you how to prevent your browser from accepting new cookies, how to have the browser notify you when you receive a new cookie, or how to disable cookies altogether. Additionally, you can disable or delete similar data used by browser add-ons, such as Flash cookies, by changing the add-on's settings or visiting the Web site of its manufacturer. Because cookies allow you to take advantage of some of ShoppingList's essential features, we recommend that you leave them turned on. For instance, if you block or otherwise reject our cookies, you will not be able to add items to your Shopping Cart, proceed to Checkout, or use any ShoppingList products and services that require you to Sign in.</p>
